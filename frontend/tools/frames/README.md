Place sequential PNG frames here to build the walkthrough video.

Naming convention: 001.png, 002.png, 003.png ...

You can create frames by taking screenshots of the app pages or by exporting slides from Figma/PowerPoint into PNGs.

Then run the script:

bash generate_walkthrough.sh

This will create `out/walkthrough.mp4` in the same folder as the script.
